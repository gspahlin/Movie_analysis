# Movie_analysis

**Journey to the Center of Movies**

This project was an attempt to discern patterns in the movies that people engage positively with. We were especially interested in correlations between user scores and 
the budget and earnings of movies. This file is to explain the files you see in the repostiory. 

Come see my spin-off project using Machine Learning to predict IMDb userbase approval and engagement!
